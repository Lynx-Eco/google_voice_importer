Well today is final day 3 of chemo. Monday is just a shot to boost red blood cells. All is going well so far except for bouts of extreme fatigue and now with high doses of steroid, blood sugar is spiking. I'm reporting it to Erika when office opens, before I take my morning mega dose.

Plenty more to tell you but it requires a phone call.
TTYS❤️
